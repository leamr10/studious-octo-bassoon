# Module 4 Challenge

This project was designed for us to create a quiz game where
users could answer questions, get points for correct answers
and time deductions for wrong answers while seeing their scores
and how they stack up against previous entries at the end of the quiz. 

I was able to accomplish this by:
    -Creating functions to start the quiz, align the questions how I want them, 
    show the high scores and return the quiz to its starting point
    -Creating arrays for questions and answers
    -Adding event listeners for each possible answer choice that would
    move the questions along and add/subtract points or time as needed
    -Setting my time function to account for the time deductions that
    come with incorrect answers
    -Saving the scores and initials into LocalStorage after user's entry using
    JSON.parse and creating a function to present the scores in desired order

This was a really tough challenge for me but I learned a ton while doing it.
Obstacles would come up that I wouldn't have thought about at all beforehand, 
such as my final screen not showing up or the answers for the questions being
out of order and I just had to tackle each issue as it came up. It was lengthy,
it was stressful, however, I feel much more confident in my abilities to
handle such problems after this challenge.
